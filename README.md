# Hands-On GPU-Accelerated Computer vision with OpenCV and CUDA

Code examples and exercies from [*Hands-On GPU-Accelerated Computer Vision with OpenCV and CUDA: Effective techniques for processing complex image data in real time using GPUs*](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-GPU-Accelerated-Computer-Vision-OpenCV-ebook/dp/B07F2K8VFT/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1553360703&sr=8-8).

All of the code in this repo is my implementation of the examples and exercises in the book and may not exatly match the code samples found there.
